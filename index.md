# First Milestone

<p></p>My first milestone was to detect position using a flex sensor and accelerometer. My first step was to create a circuit with a flex sensor and two resistors. First, I looked at a 
<a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/flex-sensor-hookup-guide/all">schematic</a>
that called for a 47k resistor, and a 50k resistor was the closest round number to 47k. As there were no 50k resistors, I learned about resistors wired in parallel to fix this issue. Since the current has more ways to flow through the circuit, there is less resistance overall. Due to this, I ended up putting two 100k resistors in parallel to each other to fix this, because when you put the two resistors in the parallel resistor formula (1/Rt = 1/R1 + 1/R2), the total resistance of the two ends up being 50k. 
<p></p>After resolving my resistor issue, I had to learn how flex sensors work. I learned that the flex sensor has ink that has conductive particles in it, and the more the sensor bends the more resistance is measured across it.
 
![HowItWorksStraight](how-it-works-straight.png)
![HowItWorksBent](how-it-works-bent.png)
<p></p><i>Figure 1; <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/flex-sensor-hookup-guide/all">Spark Fun, Flex Sensor Hookup Guide</a> - This graphic describes how a flex sensor has more resistance when it is bent.</i>

<p></p>The flex sensor is essentially a variable resistor. When we put it in a voltage divider circuit, we can use the resistance that the flex sensor gives, put the resistance into ohms law and find the voltage of it, which is something the Arduino can actually read. For example, if we take the formula V<sub>out=R2<sup>R1</sup>&frasl;<sub>R2</sub>ub>, and say the flex sensor is R2, if the resistance of it increases so does the Vo (Voltage Out). Therefore, if the flex sensor bends more and the resistance increases, so does the voltage out which the arduino reads.

![VoltageDivider](itemeditorimage_6368822ab7fb6.png)
<i><p>Figure 3; <a href="https://resources.pcb.cadence.com/blog/voltage-dividers-operations-and-functions">Voltage Dividers: Operations and Functions</a> - This is a voltage divider circuit. For my project, Z2 would be the Flex sensor and Z1 would be the parallel resistors I talked about earlier.</i>

<p></p>This can be interpreted into the degrees the sensor is bending with some code. In the code, the flex sensor gives a value of 0 - 1023, then it is normalized. I calibrated the resistance for 0 degrees and 90 degrees, with STRAIGHT_RESISTANCE (0 degrees) being 13304.4 ohms and BEND_RESISTANCE (90 degrees) being 31319.56 using the map() function in the arduino IDE. The function extrapolates the degree value to a different bend. Also, the flex sensor also can only be plugged into analog instead of digital because it has multiple values. When the sensor bends past 110 degrees, the buzzer goes off, which is the most your knees should bend when squatting.

<p></p>Next, added the Accelerometer. I found a way to display the position of the accelerometer on the Print Monitor of the Arduino IDE using the Serial Print function. After some research, I found the code and put that into the Arduino sketch with flex sensor code. Next, I wired the accelerometer to the Arduino.

![HowItWorksAccelerometer](Accelerometers-04-fullsize.png)

<p></p>Figure 2; <a href="https://insights.globalspec.com/article/1263/specifying-an-accelerometer-function-and-applications">GlobalSpec, Specifying an Accelerometer: Function and Applications</a> -  This is how a accelerometer works.

<p></p>Some challenges I had were that I had to learn about parallel resistors to solve my resistor issue. This concept took me two days to grasp, but once I learned it it made my understanding of the circuit much better. I also had to learn how to get data from an accelerometer. I had no idea how to code this, but I was able to find some code online which made adding to my code much easier.
Up next is my second milestone. I plan on attaching the bluetooth module, so I can track the data from the accelerometer and flex sensor much easier.


# Starter Project

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xf_h2ZlMCag?si=Pgq-o5lSrfOtKBD6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p></p>My starter project is a microcontroller-based Arduino project. It buzzes when I press a button and an LED goes off when it detects motion.    
<p></p>There are 5 main components in this project. The parts consist of the Arduino itself, a button, a piezo buzzer, a green LED and a PIR motion sensor. The first input and output is the button and the piezo buzzer. The piezo buzzer works by applying voltage to a piezoelectric ceramic material. The voltage causes the material to deform and vibrate, making sound waves.

![PiezoBuzzerDiagram](1606313155-gsk-04-buzzer-understand.png)
<i>Figure 1</i> ; Photo from Arduino Sensor Kit - The image shows how the buzzer vibrates to produce a tone

<p></p>The button makes the piezo buzzer buzz at a tone of about 50 hz by closing the circuit and allowing the current to flow to the buzzer. 
<p></p>The second input and output are the PIR, or Passive Infrared motion sensor and the LED, or Light Emitting Diodes. A PIR sensor detects infrared radiation. It does this by sensing a heat sourceâ€™s movements, which cause a pulse which the PIR sensor sends as a signal. When the sensor detects the heat source moving, the Arduino reads it and tells the LED to turn off. The Arduino can have code uploaded to it, and that tells the microcontroller what to do.

![PIRSensorDiagram](0118-pir_motion_sensor.jpg.png)
<i><p>Figure 2</i> ; Photo from Adafruit, Lady Ada - The image shows how the signal is generated. The heat sources passes through the detecting area and the PIR sensor registers that.

<p></p>I had a few major challenges, with the biggest one being the difficulty of uploading my code to the Arduino. The port for the Arduino would not show up on the Arduino software. Therefore I could not upload my fixed code. I tried many things to troubleshoot this issue. For example, I tried pressing the reset button on Arduino, removing and reinstalling the software, and even testing the cable and the USB-C adapter, but the issue ended up being more simple. After rewiring the board, I got it working again.
<p></p>Next, I will be working on my main project, the Knee Rehabilitation Monitor. The starter project gave me a good understanding of wiring, coding, and breadboards, so I am looking forward to my main project with this knowledge. The reason I chose my main project is because it looked like a helpful device for people with frequent knee injuries, like athletes or the elderly, and I think making something like the knee rehab monitor will help me find and make other ways to help in the future.
